Reporting bugs
===============

If you want to report a bug or if you think that something is missing,
either send me an email bdelbosc _at_ nuxeo.com or use the `github
issue tracker <https://github.com/nuxeo/FunkLoad/issues>`_.

The list of open tasks and bugs are scheduled in the `TODO 
<https://github.com/nuxeo/FunkLoad/tree/master/src/funkload/TODO.txt>`_
file.

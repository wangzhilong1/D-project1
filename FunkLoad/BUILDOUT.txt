We provide buildouts for funkload in two flavours: default and minimal.

The default ``buildout.cfg`` also installs TCPWatch, which is needed to *record* tests.

The ``minimial.cfg`` installs funkload only, without any dependencies. It is useful for 
installations where you only want to *run* the tests.

If you also want to generate reports (i.e. use ``fl-build-report``) you need to install
gnuplot. See the `installation instructions<http://funkload.nuxeo.org/INSTALL.html#id3>`_ 
for details. gnuplot has quite a few platform specific dependencies and is thus outside the 
scope of a buildout.
